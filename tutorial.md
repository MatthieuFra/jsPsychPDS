## Team tutorial for experiment construction toolkit

How can I use the Construction Toolkit to design my experiment ? 

It's very simple. 
Usually, an experiment is composed of the following elements : 

- Introduction
- Instructions & descriptions of the task 
- Some utilies forms
- Demographics
- Experiment procedure
- Contact
- Thanks

To compose your experiment with the PDS construction toolkit, first you have to copy/pase locally the elements available in [Template New Task](https://github.com/MatthieuFra/jsPsychPDS/tree/main/jspsych-ressources-team/template_new_task) to get all the folder conformed the right way. 
Then you just have to copy and paste each part of code corresponding to each part. You can use the website with the demo and pick what you need, or directly get it from the [Demo tasks availables](https://github.com/MatthieuFra/jsPsychPDS/tree/main/demos-tasks).

For the <b>experimental procedure</b> you'll need to take the code for a particular task, or you can use a [full template](https://github.com/MatthieuFra/jsPsychPDS/tree/main/jspsych-ressources-team/paradigms_template) if one is available for the type of experiment you're willing to perform. Also, it can be interesting to check the [Customized plugins](https://github.com/MatthieuFra/jsPsychPDS/tree/main/jspsych-ressources-team/custom_plugins) availables, that can help a lot. Or maybe you just need to clone an existing experiment that have be used, in that case go to [Team experiments](https://github.com/MatthieuFra/jsPsychPDS/tree/main/jspsych-ressources-team/team_experiments). 

Also feel free to use the [Working experiments](https://github.com/MatthieuFra/jsPsychPDS/tree/main/jspsych-ressources-team/working_experiments) when you are developping one, to backup your code and make it available from anywhere. Just create a folder with the project name, and save in it.
You can customize everything if you need to adjust anything. 

If you see something important missing, don't hesitate to open an issue or ask.
And if you have some piece of code that can be intersting to be share on this platform, you're very welcome to contribute !
