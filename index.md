## Psychoacoustic tasks

### Staircase method

[<b>[Code]</b>](ADD URL) [<b>[Demo]</b>](./tasks/bandit/experiment.html)

> A variation of the method of limits in which stimuli are presented in ascending and descending order. When the observerâ€™s response changes, the direction of the stimulus sequence is reversed. Differents methods of changing the stimuli can be used. 

<hr>

## Classicals paradigms for audio evaluation

<i>Partly based on Sonic Interaction Design (Franovic & Serafin, 2012) especially Chapter 5 <b>Perceptual evalutation of sound-producing objects</b> (Giordano, Susini, Bresin)</i>

### Continuous audio evaluation

> A jsPsych implementation of prospect theory gambles using icon arrays ([Banchilon et al. 2019](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09725)).

> A web-friendly implementation of the matrix reasoning item bank ([Chierchia et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.190232)). All materials were retrieved from the project's [OSF repository](https://osf.io/g96f4/) and the task design was modeled after the [Gorilla version](https://app.gorilla.sc/openmaterials/36164).

### Irrelevant Sound Effect (ISE)

[<b>[Code]</b>](ADD URL) [<b>[Demo]</b>](./tasks/spatial-recall/experiment.html)

> In the Paced Visual Serial Addition Test, participant has to add the last digit presented to the preceding digit which presented on the screen of the computer then click on the answer. This is a jsPsych implementation of the task initially described by [(Hamidi & Rohi, 2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050910003996). 

### Paced Visual Serial Addition Task

## Self-Report Plugins

### Sound system used

[<b>[Code]</b>](ADD URL) [<b>[Demo]</b>](./tasks/self-report/experiment.html?plugin=survey)

> The survey-template plugin is an extension of the jsPsych [survey-likert](https://www.jspsych.org/plugins/jspsych-survey-likert/) plugin. It displays a set of questions with Likert scale responses. For a full description of the plugin, please see the [docs page](https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/tree/main/tasks/self-report#jspsych-survey-template).

## Other ressources

### Psychoacoustics plugin

[<b>[Original website]</b>](https://jspsychophysics.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/) [<b>[GitHub]</b>](https://github.com/kurokida/jspsych-psychophysics)

> The jspsych-psychophysics plugin is developed for conducting online/Web-based psychophysical experiments using jsPsych. [(Kuroki, 2021)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-020-01445-w)



### Audio tokens plugin

[<b>[Original website]</b>](https://psyarxiv.com/3j58q/) [<b>[GitHub]</b>](github.com/pwdonh/audio_tokens)

> A Javascript toolbox to perform online rating studies with auditory material. The main feature of the toolbox is that audio samples are associated with visual tokens on the screen that control audio playback and can be manipulated depending on the type of rating. This allows the collection of single- and multi-dimensional feature ratings, as well as categorical and similarity ratings.  [(Donhauser & Klein, 2021)](https://psyarxiv.com/3j58q/)
