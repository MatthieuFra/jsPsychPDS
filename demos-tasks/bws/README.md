# BWS

Bestâ€“worst scaling (BWS) techniques involve choice modelling. Survey respondents are shown a subset of items from a master list and are asked to indicate the best and worst items (or most and least important, or most and least appealing, etc.). The task is repeated a number of times, varying the particular subset of items in a systematic way, typically according to a statistical design.
