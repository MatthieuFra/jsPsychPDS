# Verbalization 

Verbalization tasks can be used to explore qualitatively the perceptually-relevant attributes of sound-interactive events: do users focus on the characteristic of the sound signal, on the characteristic of the source or on more abstract symbolic contents associated with the sound event ? Verbalization can be free, or constrained.
