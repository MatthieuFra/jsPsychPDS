# Semantic differential

The semantic differential method can be conceived as a multidimensional extension of the ratings method seen previously. The main difference between the two methods indeed stands in the number of psychological or perceptual attributes simultaneously evaluated by the experiment participant: one for the latter, more than one for the former. In the most popular variant of the semantic differential method, participants rate each stimulus along several bipolar scales defined by opposing semantic descriptors. Each bipolar scale is usually divided in an odd number of intervals (e.g., seven).
