# Dissimilarity estimation

The goal of the dissimilarity ratings method, also known as paired comparisons method, is to measure perceptual distances between the stimuli: very similar stimuli are separated by a short perceptual distance; very different or dissimilar stimuli are separated by a long perceptual distance. On each trial of a dissimilarity ratings experi- ment, participants are presented with two stimuli and are asked to rate how dissimilar they are on a “very similar” to “very dissimilar” scale.
