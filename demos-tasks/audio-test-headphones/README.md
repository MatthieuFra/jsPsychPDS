## Audio test headphones

An implementation in jsPsych of a way to check if the participant is wearing an headphone.
Listeners judge which of three pure tones is quietest, with one of the tones presented 180Â° out of phase across the stereo channels. This task is intended to be easy over headphones but difficult over loudspeakers due to phase-cancellation
