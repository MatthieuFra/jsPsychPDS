# Preference estimation

Preference data can be collected with various experimental methods: In a paired preference comparison task, participants are presented with all the possible pairs of stimuli, one at a time, and are asked to choose which of the two they prefer. In a preference ranking task, participants are presented with all of the stimuli at once, and are asked to arrange them from the least to the most preferred. With preference ratings, participants rate their preference for each of the stimuli on a categorical or continuous scale.
