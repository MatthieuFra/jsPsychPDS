# PDS Working experiments

This depository contains all the experiments currently used the team in Cognition.run or elsewhere, to backup code.
This place is meant to backup code for currents experiments. 

Once your experiment is debugged, working and have been successfully tested, you can open an issue to create a new template to contribute to this repo.
